# Smelt-Demo

A project demonstrating Smelt. See [smelt.gnasp.com](http://smelt.gnasp.com) for more information.

## Trying the demonstration

* Install [Smelt](http://smelt.gnasp.com)
* [Download](https://github.com/GnaspGames/Smelt-Demo/archive/master.zip) or `git clone` the repository to try the demo.
* Using a command line terminal, navigate to the directory you saved/cloned the demo into.
* Run `smelt compile demo.mcc` and then see the `demo.oc` file that is created.
* Go into Minecraft 1.9^
    * Put down a command block in most north-west corner of a spawn chunk.
	* Copy the compiled command from `demo.oc` and enter into the command block.
	* Power the command block with a button (**ON THE SIDE, NOT ON TOP**).
* See the demo command blocks appear.
* *Note:* Run `smelt compile demo.mcc --copy` and instead of a `.oc` file being created, 
   the compiled command will be put copied into your clipboard.
